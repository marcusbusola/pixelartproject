# pixelartproject
My 7 days of code entry :)
This project ws created as part of my final assesement for the Udacity Front End Dev Course, Its a Pixel Art Maker.
The code looks at the FE rubric provided on the udacity website and creates a single page where the user can enter grid values and build pixel art on a customizable canvas!
It is mostly Javascript and Jquery (I struggled quite a bit lol). I want to give most of the credit to a couple of code pens and stack overflow articles that helped me when I was stuck, but I would add their links later.
This project exists mainly for assesment but also for anyone who wants to use as reference or for hep if they get stuck too. 
I hope to continue to improve on it but for the sake of assesment is is ready yaaaaaay.

Screenshots: Maybe later :) but here is a link to the demo
